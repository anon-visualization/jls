        <p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> IGS screenshots animating the movement of a six-year-old boy, Blake (blue path), and Adhir (orange path), over 8 minutes in a museum gallery. Movement is visualized over a floor plan and in a 3D space-time cube, where the z-axis represents time and the x/y axes correspond to the floor plan. Stops are represented as thick lines in the space-time view and as circles on the floor plan, where circle area and line thickness indicate stop duration respectively. The figure highlights how Blake repeatedly attempts and ultimately succeeds in leading Adhir on a tour of the gallery.
