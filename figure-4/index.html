        <p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> IGS screenshot showing the movement of all five family members in a museum gallery space over a floor plan and in a 3D space-time cube, where the z-axis represents time and the x/y axes correspond to the floor plan. Each family member is represented by a different color. Stops are shown as circles on the floor plan where area corresponds to stop duration, and as thick lines in the space-time view where length corresponds to stop duration. Conversation turns appear as rectangles along the floor plan and time axis. Video can be played and conversation read by clicking in the space-time cube.
