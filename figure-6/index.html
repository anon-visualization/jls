        <p><strong>Figure 6.</strong> Annotated screenshots from the IGS showing the movement of Adhir and Blake as they visit a gallery space together. Annotations mark Blake’s frenetic efforts to run back and forth across the gallery space to lead Adhir on a tour of other exhibits. He is finally successful when their paths intertwine in the space-time view mid-way through their visit to the gallery space. Animated demonstration video of entire family visit to this gallery space (anonymized for review): <a href="https://youtu.be/ApYVjRGojZk">here</a></p>
